| 1. What is recursion?                                     |
| 2. What is base condition in recursion?                   |
| 3. How a particular problem is solved using recursion?    |
| 4. Concept differentiation: recursion and iteration       |
| 5. Why Stack Overflow error occurs in recursion?          |
| 6. What is Tail Recursion?                                |
